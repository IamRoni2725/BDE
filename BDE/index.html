                        <li>CRM (Customer Relationship Management): Such as HubSpot or Salesforce. If there are a large number of leads, create a record for each lead in the CRM so everything remains organized.</li>

                        <li>Channels: Use email, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, or calls. In the beginning, contact them through just one channel.</li>
                        <li>Value Proposition: Don't just tell them what your product is. Explain which of their problems it will solve.</li>
